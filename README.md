tile-server
===========

TileServer serves tiles from mbtiles files. Say that five times fast.

Usage:

Put mbtiles files in a directory. Call it `tiles` or something.

    $ npm install -g https://github.com/eyeseast/tile-server.git
    $ tile-server tiles

Now go to `http://localhost:3001` and you'll see tiles.
